On userâ€™s personal list of supplements, they will be able to enter in the weights of the supplements and their personal burn rates. With the current weights of their supplements, knowing what they weights are when the packages are new and what they are when empty, it is possible to determine the amount of time left for a given supplement and determine quantity recommendations for a 90-day period order. They will also be able to get quantity recommendations for custom time frames as well. 

The significance of the 90-day period. 90-days or one quarter of the year is the optimal time-frame for which one should order supplements using a certain supplement website. Every quarter they send out discount emails for 10% discount on everything in their online store. By ordering a 90-day supply you will in affect never have to pay full price for your supplements while taking advantage of the program. Utilizing this or something similar by buying in a larger bulk may seem like a good idea, but you will run the risk of supplements deteriorating in quality before you have a chance to use them.
